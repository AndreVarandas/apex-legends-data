[Base Endpoint https://apex-legends-api.herokuapp.com](https://apex-legends-api.herokuapp.com) - It's running on Heroku, so it can take some time to boot.

### Endpoints

## Docker support

You can build your own server in three simple steps:

2. Run `docker-compose up -d`.
3. Go to your local [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/legends](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/legends).

To create your `.env` file, make a copy of the `.env-example` file or rename it to `.env`.

Years ago, she woke up in an IMC Detention Facility for the Mentally Ill with no memory of her life before. She also began hearing a distant voice whispering in her mind that would keep her awake for days on end. Despite nearly driving her insane, once she started to listen and trust it, the voice helped her harness her newfound power of void manipulation and escape the facility. Determined to uncover her true identity, Wraith began a quest to find out more about the experiments. Many of the old research facilities, however, are buried beneath heavily guarded arenas used for the Apex Games. Now Wraith has joined the competition, and with every match she gets closer to the truth.",
